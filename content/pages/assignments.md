Pecha Kucha
-----------

"Pecha Kucha" is Japanese for (roughly) "chit chat." It is a presentation style invented by some expats in Japan, involving talking while images are shown. For the first few weeks of class, we will use Pecha Kucha presentations: 10 slides (images, no text), each set to run for 20 seconds each. Please use this to introduce yourself and some aspect of popular culture and / or gender studies that you are interested in.

The "Pecha Kucha" presentations should be 3 mins.

Microtheme Response Papers
--------------------------

Microthemes will be due on most days of class to facilitate discussion. Microthemes _are not_ due on days when essays are due. In your comments, please note one key point from the author to be discussed, and respond with a criticism of your own or relate it to some aspect of popular culture that you care about (e.g., as illustration, contrast, or counterexample). These need not be polished, and you are allowed to skip one during the semester without penalty.

Microthemes should be 1-page, double-spaced.

Essays
